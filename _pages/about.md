I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://ixlab.io"> Immersive Experience Lab (IXLAB), Technische Universität Dresden </a>, working with <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/smt/im/ixlab/team/matthew-mcginity?set_language=en"> Prof. Matthew McGinity</a> and <a href="https://imld.de/en/our-group/team/raimund-dachselt/">Prof. Dr.-Ing. Raimund Dachselt</a>. My research interest includes XR data visualization, immersive analytics, immersive authoring, and 3D reconstruction. 

I’m currently working on my dissertation, `XR Visualizations for Exploring 3D Dynamics` (working title). A bigger picture of my research is to explore the usefulness of XR systems for productive applications `(Productive XR)`, especially for spatial data understanding and authoring.

Exemplary application areas of my research include the field of `Multi-User Mixed Reality (MUMR)`, with specific focus on its applications in domains such as education, psychotherapy, and <a herf="https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/smt/im/projects/hybrid-spaces">art</a>.
