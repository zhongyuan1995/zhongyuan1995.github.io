I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://ixlab.io"> Immersive Experience Lab (IXLAB), Technische Universität Dresden </a>, working with <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/smt/im/ixlab/team/matthew-mcginity?set_language=en"> Prof. Matthew McGinity</a> and <a href="https://imld.de/en/our-group/team/raimund-dachselt/">Prof. Dr.-Ing. Raimund Dachselt</a>. My research interest includes XR data visualization, immersive analytics, immersive authoring, and 3D reconstruction. 

I’m currently working on my dissertation, `User-centered XR Visualizations for Exploring 3D Motions and Structures` (working title), where I design and develop XR visualizations and systems for 3D spatial data exploration.
