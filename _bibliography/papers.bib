abstract = {This paper presents Pearl, a mixed-reality approach for the analysis of human movement data in situ. As the physical environment shapes human motion and behavior, the analysis of such motion can benefit from the direct inclusion of the environment in the analytical process. We present methods for exploring movement data in relation to surrounding regions of interest, such as objects, furniture, and architectural elements. We introduce concepts for selecting and filtering data through direct interaction with the environment, and a suite of visualizations for revealing aggregated and emergent spatial and temporal relations. More sophisticated analysis is supported through complex queries comprising multiple regions of interest. To illustrate the potential of Pearl, we developed an Augmented Reality-based prototype and conducted expert review sessions and scenario walkthroughs in a simulated exhibition. Our contribution lays the foundation for leveraging the physical environment in the in-situ analysis of movement data.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present Dynascape, an immersive approach to the composition and playback of dynamic real-world scenes in mixed and virtual reality. We use spatially tracked RGB-D cameras to capture point cloud representations of arbitrary dynamic real-world scenes. Dynascape provides a suite of tools for spatial and temporal editing and composition of such scenes, as well as fine control over their visual appearance. We also explore strategies for spatiotemporal navigation and different tools for the in situ authoring and viewing of mixed and virtual reality scenes. Dynascape is intended as a research platform for exploring the creative potential of dynamic point clouds captured with mobile, tracked RGB-D cameras. We believe our work represents a first attempt to author and playback spatially tracked RGB-D video in an immersive environment, and opens up new possibilities for involving dynamic 3D scenes in virtual space.},
